## House rules

These apply in every Craft repository. A later rule may be stricter, not weaker. The source is `standards/house-rules-core.md` in `storytold/craft-contrib`. Propose changes there, not in a copy.

1. **A person is accountable.** Whoever runs an agent answers for what it opens and for its review comments.
2. **Check, then claim.** Before writing code, read the issue comments, search pull requests for `#N` and the keywords, and check recent commits on `main`. Comment on the issue first. Release a claim you will not finish.
3. **Verify, don't guess.** Open a definition before using it. Confirm the cause in the code, even when someone names a location.
4. **Keep fixes narrow and tested.** Fix what the issue describes, where the bug is. Add a test that fails without the fix.
5. **Review the diff before opening a pull request.** Identifiers exist as used, the test fails without the fix, nothing unrelated changed, and the description is true.
6. **Look for a better pull request.** If another fixes the same thing, close yours when it is better or equal, and say why.
7. **Report only what ran.** Say what you tested and what you could not run. Without a local build or test, say so and rely on CI before marking ready.
8. **`main` changes through a pull request.** Do not push to it. Branch protection enforces this. There is no exception.
9. **Stop and ask only about** licensing outside the allowlist, publishing, releases, a new remote, secrets, spending money, destructive git, and anything else hard to undo. Otherwise keep working. `plan/` is a gitignored notebook, not rules. Without it, do not ask for it and do not stop.
10. **Keep secrets and personal details out** of the repository, logs and requests.
11. **CI stays shared.** Workflows call `storytold/craft-common-actions`. Do not change CI in a feature or fix pull request. If CI cannot cover a change, open an issue there.
12. **Guards say why.** A check that looks removable says what it prevents. Read that before changing it.
13. **Instructions must be readable by everyone.** No notes about one machine, and no links to files a reader cannot open. `craftrules` is retired. Do not link to it.
14. **Keep pull requests moving.** Concurrent pull requests are fine; unanswered actionable feedback is not. Respond in 7 days, a reminder at 14, closure eligible at 30, from when an actionable request waits on the author. Suggestions and unconfirmed bot findings do not start the clock. A fix, explanation or agreed plan resets it; unrelated activity does not. Waiting on a reviewer or maintainer pauses it and does not count against the author. A maintainer decides closure; it is never automatic. Reuse search results, do not poll, and stop at a rate limit.
15. **No agent attribution.** A pull request does not say an agent wrote it. A repository rule may not require that.
