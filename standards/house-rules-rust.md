## Rust Craft repositories

These apply to native Craft apps and to shared Rust libraries. Select them by repository type. A repository that merely contains some Rust does not take this block. Rules later in a repository's file may be stricter, but not weaker. The source is `standards/house-rules-rust.md` in [storytold/craft-contrib](https://github.com/storytold/craft-contrib).

1. **Never crash.** Non-test code does not panic and has no `unsafe`, except where the repository file names an exception. Return errors, treat input as hostile, and bound recursion and allocations. New production crate roots copy the `deny` attribute from an existing crate: `clippy::unwrap_used`, `clippy::expect_used`, `clippy::panic`, `clippy::unimplemented`, `clippy::todo`, `clippy::unreachable`. Every crash fix comes with a test that panicked before the fix.
2. **Clean room.** Learn from observed behaviour and public specifications. Do not copy another product's code, assets, strings or artwork. Check a dependency's licence before adding it.
3. **Assets and fonts.** Every asset is original or suitably licensed, and is recorded in `ATTRIBUTION.md` in the same change. Font files live in [storytold/craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), not in the app repository.
4. **Rust only for native Craft apps.** No handwritten JavaScript or TypeScript, and no Tauri, Electron or webview shell, in those apps. Shared tooling follows its documented technical scope and maintainer-approved exceptions. Craft PR Review's existing Tauri and TypeScript UI is one such exception. It does not relax this rule for native apps. Preserve any existing web build.
5. **Time goes through `chrono`.** Do not hand-roll calendar conversion. For dates beyond what `chrono` can represent, follow [standards/time.md](time.md).
6. **Contributor credits.** Add or edit only your own person's entry in `contributors/people.toml`, and only after asking them. Never guess a name or hand-edit `contributors.json`.

## Licence allowlist

Dependencies and assets use SPDX identifiers. An expression is allowed when every identifier is in this list. A repository may name a shorter list. It may not add an identifier here by editing its own copy of these rules.

- `ISC`
- `MIT`
- `BSD-2-Clause`
- `BSD-3-Clause`
- `Apache-2.0`
- `OFL-1.1`
- `Ubuntu-font-1.0`
- `Bitstream-Vera`
- `CC0-1.0`
- `CC-BY-4.0`
- `CC-BY-SA-4.0`
- `LicenseRef-Public-Domain`

`LicenseRef-Storyteller-Trademark` is not in this list. It covers Storyteller brand marks only, where a repository already says so.
